# Dog Party

###### Dog Party is my first project at Turing and was assigned to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. I was provided with 2 Comps and instructed to re-create them with one HTML structure plus two CSS stylesheets. 

###### Through this project I was also able to practice and experiment with JavaScript along with other topics, including Media Queries and style guide best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Below, please find screen grabs of the comps:
